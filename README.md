# Airlines Dataset Analysis

This is a Python project that analyzes a large dataset from Indian airline companies, covering the period from March 2019 to June 2019. The dataset includes information on flight schedules, ticket prices, and other relevant details for each flight. The project aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices for future flights, based on the data from the dataset.

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from public sources, including airline company websites and online travel agencies. The dataset includes information on over 10,000 flights from major Indian airline companies.

## Technologies Used
The project was implemented in Python, using popular data analysis and machine learning libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Installation Instructions
To run the project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install these libraries using the pip package manager by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage Instructions
To use the project, simply run the main.py file, which will execute the data analysis and machine learning algorithms. The project includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for each stage of the analysis, as well as documentation and comments to guide you through the process.
